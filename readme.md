#### What?

  - detects resolution of videos,
  - hashes them,
  - renames accordingly.

Imagine you have a bunch of videos, and you want to rename them according to their resolution.

There's a file called `vid12356000s0.mp4` in your directory.

If you run `hashporn`, it will rename the video to `2160-7f7640d154377f1a9466effd1b6c085e6eb63030.mp4`.

#### Why?

Certain kinds of connoisseurs have been known to use this tool to unify their collection.

#### Notes

`cargo` requires a rust installation.
